### Day 0: May 28th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 

Artificial Intelligence

1, Python: Read about the built-in String class, FOR and IN constructs as well as the need to import pandas as pd because the built-in methods that overlap with pandas methods.

2, NLTK: Read about tokenization.

3, cURL: Read the manual.

**Thoughts:** Focus.
